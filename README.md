## Running 

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Koorye/PCD-real.git
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
bash scripts/install_dependencies.sh
```

3. Download the pretrained checkpoints:

> **Note**: Some of the checkpoints cannot be downloaded directly, you may need to download them manually from the links provided in the script.

```bash
bash scripts/download_pretrained_weights.sh
```

4. Fine-tune your own model. More details can be found in official repository of [Pi-0](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi).

5. Deploy the model:

**Baseline**

```bash
python scripts/deploy_server.py \
    --config_name your_config_name \ # example: pi0_real
    --checkpoint_bucket /path/to/your/finetuned/checkpoint/bucket
```

**+PCD (Ours)**

```bash
python scripts/deploy_server.py \
    --config_name your_config_name_pcd \ # example: pi0_real_pcd
    --checkpoint_bucket /path/to/your/finetuned/checkpoint/bucket
```

6. Implement your own inference script based on the provided example in `scripts/inference_test.py`.
